<h1>Rules:</h1>
<p>he game takes thirteen turns. Each turn consists of up to three separate rolls of the dice. On the first roll you roll all five of the dice. After the first and second roll, you can hold any subset of the five dice you want (including none of the dice or all of the dice) and roll the rest trying to get a good combination. After the three rolls (or after the first or second roll if you choose to stop) you must find a place among the thirteen boxes in the scorecard to put your score. The score you get depends on the box that you choose and the combination that you have rolled. After a box is used, you can't use it again, so you have to choose wisely. This means that, in general, you don't have to choose the box that gives you the highest score for the combination you have rolled, since it may be advantageous to save that box for an even better roll later in the game. 
    In fact, there are many situations it which it makes sense to put a 0 in a "bad" box instead of a low score in another "good" box because doing so would block the good box for future turns.</p>

  <h1>How to play:</h1>

  <h3 >The Upper Section:</h3>

  <p>In the upper section, there are six boxes, each corresponding to one of the six face values of the dice. For these boxes, you enter the sum of the dice with the corresponding face value (and ignore all other dice). For example, if you roll 5 3 3 5 3 you may enter a score of 9 in the third spot or a score of 10 in the fifth spot.</p>

        <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Object
        of the game</span><br>
        <br>
        The object of Yahtzee is to obtain the highest score from throwing 5
        dice.<br>
        The game consists of 13 rounds. In each round, you roll the dice and
        then score the roll in one of 13 categories. You must score once in
        each category. The score is determined by a different rule for each
        category.<br>
        The game ends once all 13 categories have been scored.<br>
        <br>
        If you enjoy playing games like yahtzee you may like online casino games where you can find a big variety of Asian <a href="https://www.uk-online-slots.co.uk/new-slots/">and new slots games</a>.
        <br><br>
        
        <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Game
        Start</span><br>
        <br>
        To start with, roll all the dice. After rolling you can either score
        the current roll (see below), or re-roll any or all of the dice.<br>
        <br>
        You may only roll the dice a total of 3 times. After rolling 3 times
        you must choose a category to score.<br>
        <br>
        You may score the dice at any point in the round, i.e. it doesn't have
        to be after the 3rd roll.<br>
        <br>
        
        <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Scoring</span><br>
        <br>
        To score your combination of 5 dice, you click one of the 13 boxes, or
        write it on the scorecard (scoresheet). There are two sections to the
        score table - the Upper Section and the Lower Section.<br>
        <br>
        Once a box has been scored, it cannot be scored again for the rest of
        the game (except the Yahtzee category), so choose wisely.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Upper
        Section Scoring</span><br>
        <br>
        If you score in the upper section of the table, your score is the total
        of the specified die face.<br>
        So if you roll:<br>
        5 - 2 - 5 - 6 - 5 and score in the Fives category, your total for the
        category would be 15, because there are three fives, which are added
        together.<br>
        If the One, Three or Four Categories were selected for scoring with
        this roll, you would score a zero.<br>
        If placed in the Two or Six category, you would score 2 and 6
        respectively.<br>
        <br>
        Bonus If the total of Upper scores is 63 or more, add a bonus of 35.
        Note that 63 is the total of three each of 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s and 6s.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Lower
        Section Scoring</span><br>
        <br>
        In the lower scores, you score either a set amount, or zero if you
        don't satisfy the category requirements.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3 and 4 of
        a kind</span>
        For 3 of a kind you must have at least 3 of the same die faces. You
        score the total of all the dice. For 4 of a kind you would need 4 die
        faces the same.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Small and
        Large Straight</span>
        A Straight is a sequence of consecutive die faces, where a small
        straight is 4 consecutive faces, and a large straight 5 consecutive
        faces.<br>
        Small straights score 30 and a large 40 points.<br>
        So if you rolled:<br>
        2 - 3 - 2 - 5 - 4<br>
        you could score 30 in small straight or 0 in large straight.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Full House</span>
        A
        Full House is where you have 3 of a kind and 2 of a kind. Full houses
        score 25 points.<br>
        i.e.:<br>
        3 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2<br>
        would score 25 in the Full House category.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">First
        Yahtzee</span> A
        Yahtzee is 5 of a kind and scores 50 points, although you may elect NOT
        to score it as a yahtzee, instead choosing to take it as a top row
        score and safegaurd you bonus.
        
        <big><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(0, 102, 0);"><br><br>Additional
        Yahtzees</span></big>.
        If you roll a second Yahtzee in a game, and you scored your first
        yahtzee in the Yahtzee box, you would score a further bonus 100 points
        in the yahtzee box. You must also put this roll into another category,
        as follows;<br>
        -If the corresponding Upper section category is not filled then you
        must score there.<br>
        ie if you rolled 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 and the Fours Category is not
        filled, you must put the score in the Fours category.<br>
        <br>
        -If the corresponding Upper section category is filled you may then put
        the score anywhere on the Upper Section (scoring zero). In 3 of a Kind,
        4 of a Kind, and Chance categories you would score the total of the die
        faces. For the Small Straight, Large Straight, and Full House
        categories, you would score 30, 40 and 25 points respectively.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chance</span>
        You can
        roll anything and be able to put it in the Chance category. You score
        the total of the die faces.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Scratch
        or Dump scores.</span> <br>
        <br>
        You can score any roll in any category at any time, even if the
        resulting score is zero. Eg, you<br>
        can take 2-3-3-4-6 in the 5's category. It will score 0. This could be
        used near the end of a game to lose a poor roll against a
        difficult-to-get category that you've failed to fill (eg, long straight
        or yahtzee).<br><br>
